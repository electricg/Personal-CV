Thank you for taking a look at the source code,
it means you really do care about it
and I haven't wasted my time working on it
(instead of doing a better-looking Word version).
As you can see, I've used HTML5 Boilerplate as the
base template, Selectivizr for old IEs CSS3 support
and hCard microformat for a little bit of semantic.
Plus there's a little trick if you go over my name :)

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>I started studying HTML more in 1998 during high school, and since then I've never stopped learning about the new technologies that arise in the web, keeping myself updated through the use of RSS feeds earlier and Twitter now.</p>
    <p>On the Front End side, I've always believed in and tried to reach the perfect division between semantic HTML markup and presentational CSS, trying to balance the clients' requests for a pixel-perfect design with the new techniques brought by modern browsers and with the cardinal idea of a web accessible to all.</p>
    <p>Nowadays my interest is towards the new techniques and technologies that are involved in the web development for the moltitude of devices available now and in the next future.</p>
    <p>I'm not a &ldquo;9-to-5&rdquo; coder. I live this job as one of my passion and, as such, I put as much effort as I can into it, by studying everyday, trying to find best solutions for every task and by getting full understanding of my technical choices. Thus I expect to work for a company who considers this as a must for every developer, since I want to share knowledge with my colleagues and improve myself day by day with them.</p>
