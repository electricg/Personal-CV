#Personal CV

My personal curriculum vitae (minus some of my contact details, if you are interested in hiring me you can send me a message through GitHub).

I've used HTML5 Boilerplate as the base template, Selectivizr for old IEs CSS3 support and hCard microformat for a little bit of semantic.
Plus there's a little trick if you go with the mouse over my name.

There is also a stylesheet for the printing version, which makes it really easy to create a PDF version of the file (in Google Chrome for example select "Print" and then save it as a PDF).

Works in:
