I live this job as one of my passion and, as such, I put as much effort as I can into it, by studying everyday, trying to find best solutions for every task and by getting full understanding of my technical choices. Thus I expect to work for a company who considers this as a must for every developer, since I want to share knowledge with my colleagues and improve myself day by day with them."
