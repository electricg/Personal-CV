My personal curriculum vitae (minus my contact details to avoid spam, if you are interested in hiring me you can always send me a message through GitHub).

I've used HTML5 Boilerplate as the base template, Selectivizr for old IEs CSS3 support and hCard microformat for a little bit of semantic.
Plus there's a little trick if you go with the mouse over my name.
